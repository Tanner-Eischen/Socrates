    "Is it just 10 times 7? That would be 70?",
    "Actually, I think triangles are different. But I can't remember the formula exactly.",
    "Maybe it's half of that? So 35? But I'm not sure why.",
    "I think the formula involves base and height, but I'm mixing it up with rectangle area.",
    "So it's (1/2) × base × height? That would be 35 cm²? I think that's it!"
